# Druver

This project was a starting point for testing game development in Python using Pygame. 
The game itself isn't finished and is not playable, but it has some interesting implementations; such as "faked 3D graphics".

I found library and GUI development more fun so the development has since been switched to https://github.com/15minutOdmora/python-pyggui to build an easy-to-use Pygame GUI library. 

Even if it isn't finished, I experimented alot and got some nice resoults, below gif previews some of the implementations:
